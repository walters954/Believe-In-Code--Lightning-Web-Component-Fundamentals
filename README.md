Lightning Web Component Fundamentals
====================================

Welcome to the Lightning Web Component (LWC) Fundamentals repository! This repo is designed to help you learn the basics and advanced concepts of LWC development in Salesforce. This course is based on the [Believe in Code: Lightning Web Component Fundamentals](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/p/believe-in-code-lightning-web-component-fundamentals) by Salesforce Mentor.

Why Learn LWC?
--------------

Lightning Web Components (LWC) is a modern and powerful framework for building custom user interfaces on the Salesforce platform. As a Salesforce developer, mastering LWC is essential for creating efficient, scalable, and high-performance applications. Learning LWC will not only enhance your skill set but also improve your job prospects as a Salesforce developer.

Course Overview
---------------

The course is divided into three sections:

1.  Introduction to LWC: In this section, you'll learn about the basics of the LWC framework, its benefits, and how it fits into the Salesforce ecosystem. You'll also get a brief introduction to web components and how they relate to LWC.

2.  LWC Basics: This section covers the fundamental concepts of LWC development, such as creating components, handling events, working with data binding, and using conditional rendering. You'll also learn about the essential tools and best practices for developing LWCs.

3.  LWC Advanced: In the advanced section, you'll dive deeper into LWC development, learning about more complex topics like parent-child communication, working with Apex, using wire services, and handling errors. This section will also cover advanced component patterns and performance optimization techniques.

Course Includes Hands-on LWC Todo List Projects
-------------------------------

One of the best ways to learn and master Lightning Web Components is by working on hands-on projects. In this course, you'll have the opportunity to follow along with the [LWC Todo List Project](https://courses.salesforcementor.com/p/lwc-project-todo-list), a guided tutorial that will help you build a functional and interactive Todo List application using LWC.

During the project, you'll learn how to:

-   Create custom LWC components to manage and display your Todo List items.
-   Implement data binding and event handling to manage user interactions.
-   Leverage parent-child communication and component composition to create modular and reusable components.

By the end of this course and Project, you'll gain valuable hands-on experience and practical knowledge that will reinforce your understanding of LWC development. This will enable you to build your own custom components on the Salesforce platform and prepare you for real-world Salesforce development projects.
